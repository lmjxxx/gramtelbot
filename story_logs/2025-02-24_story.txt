In the quaint village of Larkspur, nestled between rolling emerald hills and dense, whispering forests, there stood an old stone cottage covered in ivy. This was the home of Elara, a woman known for her peculiar affinity with the stars. Every night, as the sky cloaked itself in darkness and the stars twinkled like scattered diamonds, Elara would climb to her rooftop observatory with her beloved telescope.

Elara was not like the other villagers. While the townsfolk busied themselves with everyday chores and chatter, Elara would listen to the stories of the wind and the secrets of the night.
